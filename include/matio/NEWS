Changes in 1.5.2 (31 July 2013)
* Added support for linear data read for v4 and HDF5 MAT files
* Fixed bug reading slices of variables in matdump
* Fix feof calls so they compile on platforms that dereference the argument in
  a macro
* More robust checking that file is MAT file and eliminates some segmentation
  faults
* Various fixes for unused variables, unnecessary initializations, etc. that
  cause compilers to issue diagnostices
* Several other fixes

Changes in 1.5.1 (10 March 2013)
* Fix bug writing compressed HDF5 files
* Fix bug reading cell array elements written with a non-empty variable name
* Fix bug writing complex sparse matrices as struct fields or cell elements to
  uncompressed v5 MAT files
* Fix a number of potential issues identified via static analysis
* Fix uninitialized pointers when creating structures through
  Mat_VarCreateStruct, and fix a bug in the struct API testsuite
* Fix extended sparse support in v7.3 MAT files and add 64-bit integer support
  for v5 MAT files
* Add missing support for reading hyperslabs from HDF5 MAT files
* Added variable indexing notation support to matdump to display subsets of
  variables
* Added tests for extended sparse support in testsuite
* Add missing enumerations or default case in switch statements

Changes in 1.5.0 (15 April 2012)
* Support for reading/writing HDF5 format MAT files
* Bug fixes for compressed variables that caused issues with matio reading
  them.
* Upgrade of dimensions in matvar_t structure to size_t enabling support for
  large arrays.
* A testsuite

Changes in 1.3.2 (28 October 2006)
* Added support for writing compressed character classes, structures, cell arrays, and sparse arrays
* Added some tests to the test_mat program: write_compressed_cell, write_compressed_sparse
* Added 64-bit signed/unsigned integer support
* Fixed bugs in Reading slabs of N-dimensional data

Changes in 1.3.1 (7 Septempber 2006)
* Added some internal documentation to the library
* Defined two documentation groups public and internal
* Disabled the building of test programs by default and added a configure
  option to build them
* Fixed installation path of data and documentation
* Fixed bugs where file pointers were left open if allocating memory failed in Mat_Open and Mat_Create

Changes in 1.3.0 (30 June 2006)
* Cleaned out matio.h and made most preproccessor define's into enum's.
* Moved complex arrays from single pointer with real part followed by imaginary
  part to a struct with a pointer to the real part and a pointer to the
  imaginary part (Previous implementation was just plain ignorant).
* Changed version 4 mat file code from MAT_V4 to MAT_FT_MAT4 to match the
  version 5 identifier.
* Added function Mat_VarCalloc to allocate and initialize all fields of the
  matvar_t structure.
Bug Fixes in 1.3.0 (30 June 2006)
* WriteCompressedData did not initialize the data tag (data_tag variable).
* WriteStructField wrote the array name tag as a 2 byte integer followed by 2
  padding bytes. Correct implementation writes the array name tag as a 4 byte
  integer.
* Write5 wrote the array name tag as a 2 byte integer followed by 2
  padding bytes when the name was more than 4 characters. Correct
  implementation writes the array name tag as a 4 byte integer.
* Write5 had a hard-coded uncompressed variable size of 448 when writing
  compressed data.
* WriteInfo5 wrote the array name tag as a 2 byte integer followed by 2
  padding bytes when the name was more than 4 characters. Correct
  implementation writes the array name tag as a 4 byte integer.
* Mat_Create wrote the endian sequence incorrectly.
* Mat_VarCreate set the number of bytes incorrectly for structures.
* Mat_VarCreate fixed the data size of the character class to 1. That didn't
  allow for multi-byte characters.

Changes in 1.1.6 (20 March 2006)
* Added sparse class to compressed variable.
Bug Fixes in 1.1.6 (20 March 2006)
* Fixed release bug in reading double class data.
* Fixed various compressed variable writing bugs.
* Fixed a bug in Mat_VarCreate for sparse variables.

Changes in 1.1.4 (9 February 2006)
* Changed Licensing from the GNU General Public License to the GNU Lesser
  General Public License.
* Added support for reading numeric version 4 MAT files
* Added support for sparse datatypes other than double.  Although Matlab does
  not support these types, other free software does.
* Writing compressed variables is supported for Numeric arrays.  Future versions
  will implement character,sparse,cell, and structure arrays.
* A fortran 90/95 interface has been incorporated.  Not all functions are
  implemented yet, but more will come and it is at least functional now.
  Hopefully feedback will help guide the fortran interface development.
* Replaced preprocessor defines for types,classes,etc. with enum's.
Bug Fixes in 1.1.4 (9 January 2006)
* Mat_VarReadData did not handle complex data
